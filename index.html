This is my first web page. It contains information about the american bison. 
It has a description of bison and a short history of bison in the united states.
My web page also contains a table of bison growth in the United States within the 
early 20th century. Additional reading/resources on yellowstone bison are included
using links at the bottom of my page. Three bison pictures are also included on 
my web page.

          <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bison are the largest land-dwelling mammals in North America standing between 5 and 6.5 feet in height and weighing close 
            to a ton. Bison are covered in dense dark brown hair with short curved horns and a protruding strong shoulder hump. 
            Bison are excellent swimmers and extremely fast. They can run at speeds up to 35 miles per hour. Bison also have great
            hearing, vision, and sense of smell. Bison are very social animals and form herds of up to 1,000 during mating season.
            Bison feed on plains grasses, herbs, shrubs, and twigs.

        <h3>History in America</h3>
    <p>
        The American bison once roamed across most of North America in numbers that reached into the tens of millions.
        Bison were a critical part of Native American culture and provided tribes with their main food source. As European 
        Americans settled the west in the 1800s, the U.S. Army began a campaign to remove Native American tribes by taking away their main food source
        and killing off the native bison. Hundreds of thousands of bison were killed by U.S.troops and market hunters. By the late 1880s, the great herds of bison that
        once dominated the landscape were nearly gone. In 1902, Yellowstone began it's efforts to recover the bison population. The Table to the right
        shows the growth in the Yellowstone bison popluation starting in 1902.
